# POINT-OF-SALE
The project “POINT OF SALE” aims to make automation of sales and
purchases products. It’s a combination of hardware and software programs
used primarily by a business to processes sale and purchase by the
merchant.
I am a student of computer application and during the course of BCA I have
learned many languages and tools so that I can make any type of software
with any amount of difficulties and facilities. The main aim behind the
creation of the project is to apply all the tools that have been taught during
BCA Course.
I have done the project in “Asp.net using C# Web Application” along with
the “SQL server 2008”. As per as Asp.net concerned is user friendly and
one can give any type of user friendly facility to the Web Application.

The point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place
where a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the
merchant would calculate the amount owed by the customer and indicate
the amount, and may prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be
a cash register printout), and indicate the options for the customer to
make payment. It is also the point at which a customer makes a
payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a
service. After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt for
the transaction, which is usually printed, but is increasingly being
dispensed with or sent electronically.
"Point Of sale" To calculate the amount owed by a customer, the
merchant may use any of a variety of aids available, such as weighing
scales, barcode scanners, and cash registers. To make a
payment, payment terminals, touch screens, and a variety of other
hardware and software options are available.
